# 🐟 Dodgy Fish

**Dodgy Fish** is a simple 2D game made in **Unity**, inspired by obstacle-dodging arcade games.

You control a dodgy little fish swimming through **underwater ruins**, trying to pass between pillars without colliding with them. The game focuses on timing, movement, and basic physics.

## 🎮 Gameplay
- Press **Space** to make the fish swim upward
- Avoid hitting the underwater ruins
- Survive as long as possible and score points by passing obstacles

## 🛠 Built With
- Unity (2D)
- C#
- Rigidbody2D, Box/Circle Colliders2D, basic physics & spawning logic

## 📌 Project Notes
This project was created as a learning exercise to:
- Understand Unity’s coordinate system and scaling
- Work with Rigidbody2D, Collider2D, velocity, and `Time.deltaTime`
- Implement object spawning and movement
- Build and export a playable game
- Use Git/GitHub with a Unity project

The game is stable and playable, with room for future improvements.
